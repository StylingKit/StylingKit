# StylingKit

StylingKit is an iOS framework that allows you to style your application using stylesheets and a CSS-like syntax. StylingKit lets you build  beautiful applications with less code and more flexibility by using familiar CSS markup to style native controls and components. Free up your team to focus on creating amazing user experiences throughout the design and development cycle.

Feedback, improvements, and pull requests are very welcome.

## Themes

With StylingKit you can style an entire iOS app with CSS, making an app theme-able by applying different collections of CSS classes. Changing the theme of an app is as simple as switching out the CSS file.

Themes consist of various classes that work together to style controls and views in your app. All themes have a default.css file which contains all of the styles included with the theme. A theme can also include a set of Sass (or other [CSS Preprocessors](#css-preprocessors)) files that compile into the default.css file.

### CSS Preprocessors

The StylingKit's CSS support is based on the W3C's CSS specification. It means that most CSS tools out there, like CSS preprocessors, should work just fine with.

The preprocessor of choice by StylingKit team is Sass, therefore all the documentation and themes are provided in its format. However your app can use whatever CSS Preprocessors you like.

## Example project [[under construction]]

You can try StylingKit by running `pod try StylingKit` from the terminal.

Alternatively you can clone repo manually:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/StylingKit/StylingKit.git
cd StylingKit/Example
open StylingKit.xcworkspace
```

## Installation
### CocoaPods

StylingKit is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "StylingKit", :git => "https://github.com/StylingKit/StylingKit"
```

### Carthage

StylingKit is available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Cartfile:

```
github "StylingKit/StylingKit"
```

### Integrating with your app
Integration is super simple. You don't need to do anything if you are using CocoaPods with frameworks enabled or Carthage.

If you use Objective-C and CocoaPods without frameworks you will have to add the following lines to your `AppDelegate.m`:

```
#import <StylingKit/StylingKit.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
	[[StylingKit sharedKit] startStyling];
}

```
### Add stylesheet

The last, but not least required step is to add stylesheet to your app. The default stylesheet file `default.css` will be loaded from your app's main bundle automatically. For more information on defining your app style in `default.css` see [Styling Reference](#styling-reference) and [Themes](#themes) sections.

## Styling Reference

StylingKit uses Pixate Freestyle internally, and so far style handling is 100% compatible. You can reference [pixate-freestyle-ios/style-reference](http://pixate.github.io/pixate-freestyle-ios/////style-reference/index.html) for now.

Please keep in mind that while StylingKit evolves it may become incomaptible with original Pixate Freestyle. This page will always reflect the most recent documentation links.


## Versioning

StylingKit project uses the following versioning scheme {Major}.{Sprint}.{Patch}

- Major - significant or breaking change
